                            DESCRIBED AS AN ABNORMAL ENLARGEMENT OF THE THYROID GLAND, a goiter is a health issue that concerns many Filipinos.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although goiters are usually painless, they are however unsightly and can cause coughing or difficulty of breathing.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           Thus, specialists at CebuDoc are constantly updating themselves with state-of-the-art surgical treatments for those with the condition.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Being at the forefront in the development of minimally invasive surgery, Cebu Doctors University Hospital performed the first removal of the goiter using a laparoscope. Called Bilateral Axillo- Breast Access Thyroidectomy (BABA), the procedure was done by Dr. Henry Chua last June 13, 2011. The scar was hidden from the site as the incision was made in front of the axilla.

                        <p>
                            A recent development in the surgical treatment for goitersâ€”the Transoral Endoscopic Thyroidectomy-Vestibular Approach (TOETVA), was popularized by Professor Angkun Anuwong of Thailand.

                        <p>
                            Always a step ahead, CebuDoc had its first TOETVA done by Professor Jin Wook Yi of Korea last August 7, 2019. In less than an hour, the goiter was successfully removed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Under the leadership of Dr. Manuel Villamor, MD of the Department of Surgery, CebuDoc is now offering TOETVA. As of this writing, more than 30 cases have been performed successfully and without any complications.
