                                <p class="block-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">SCDHI was previously the San Carlos Planters' and Laborers' Hospital under the management of San Carlos Planters' Association, Inc. (SCPA). On October 18, 2001, a Memorandum of Agreement was entered into by SCPA and Dr. Potenciano V. Larrazabal, Jr., thereby making way to the birth of a new and only Private Hospital in San Carlos City, Negros Occidental, the San Carlos Doctors Hospital, Inc. <br><br>

                                The old San Carlos Planters' and Laborers' Hospital building was completely renovated and transformed into a prestigious landmark. Its soft opening was on March 03, 2003 and the inauguration of San Carlos Doctors Hospital, Inc. happened on April 21, 2003, concurrent to the birth date of the President and Chairman of the Board of Directors at that time, Dr. Potenciano V. Larrazabal, Jr.. It was then that a new hospital was added to the <strong>CebuDoc Group of Hospitals</strong>, the San Carlos Doctors' Hospital, Inc.<br><br>

                                Since the birth of San Carlos Doctors' Hospital, Inc., there had been numerous events that brought the institution into where it is now. The newly-born establishment started as a primary hospital with 50-bed capacity. Among the services offered were Emergency Room Services, Primary Laboratory, Radiologic Service (General X-Ray), Pediatrics, Ophthalmology, Out-Patient Services, Surgery (General Surgery and ENT/Head and Neck), Anesthesia, Cardiology (EKG), Medicine, and OB-Gynecology.<br><br>

                                Over the years, San Carlos Doctors' Hospital, Inc. has added more valuable services to the public. Among others were <strong>Intensive Care Unit (Acute Stroke Unit and Pediatrics Intensive Care Unit), Ultrasound Services, HemoDialysis Center and Echocardiogram (2D Echo)</strong>.<br><br>

                                In its recent operations, San Carlos Doctors' Hospital, Inc. aims to provide <strong>Computed Tomography Scanning Services (CT Scan)</strong> to the public,  to end up the long-felt burden of the patients travelling to the far-flung hospitals in order to avail of such services.
