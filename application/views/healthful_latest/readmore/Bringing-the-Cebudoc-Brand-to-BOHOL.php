                           CEBUDOC GROUP INTRODUCES ANOTHER EXCITING MILESTONE as it carries out its commitment to provide compassionate, high-quality, and innovative healthcare in the Visayas — the newly acquired hospital in the province of Bohol.

                        <p>
                            At BoholDoc, the people of Bohol will soon experience the globally known healthcare services of CebuDoc Group. A two-storey building measuring 766 square meters per floor, BoholDoc will offer a newly renovated emergency department, private rooms with balcony, advanced technology, an operating room, and a tennis court with native trees, among other features.

                        <p>
                           Minor construction is ongoing as the hospital continues to innovate in line with its aim to serve patients better. The hospital staff will soon be stocking the building with medical supplies and furnishings and eventually sterilizing the space that has been a construction zone for months. Physicians, nurses, staff and volunteers have undergone special training in Cebu Doctors University Hospital to familiarize themselves with the new hospital before it opens to patient care.
