It has been at the forefront of Refractive Surgery since 2002 and has performed the most number of Lasik Procedures outside Metro Manila.<br>
                                <br>Cebu Doctors' University Hospital's Centre for Sight Laser Center is pleased to be the first center in Cebu that marks the Alcon Wavelight Refractive Station, advancement in vision correction technology which offers the patients increased speed, accuracy and safety. In fact, it is the fastest excimer laser system available in the United States today.<br>
                                <br>In order to ensure the safest treatment possible, the <strong>Alcon Wavelight Rerfacrtive Station</strong> minutely and continuously adjusts its laser to the position of the patient's eye. Every four to six milliseconds, the eye's location is measured and the internal mirrors of the system are automatically aligned. Just before the laser's pulse is released, a second check is made to confirm that the eye has not moved. This happens 400 times every second, once for every year laser pulse. If, at any time, the eye moves too quickly to be measured or moves out of range, the laser will instantly stop and wait for the eye to return to position.</p>
