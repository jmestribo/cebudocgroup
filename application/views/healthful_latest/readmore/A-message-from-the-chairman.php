                        Over the past few years, CebuDoc Group has continuously delivered its commitment to provide compassionate, high quality, and innovative service. In our six-hospital brands, we have geared our team with the most advanced and modern healthcare technology as we prepare for the rapid growth of the healthcare industry.

                    <p>
                        In our first quarter, we upgraded our CathLab in CebuDoc with the latest cardiac catheterization technology that features Dynamic Cardiac Road Mapping designed to produce clearer and more vivid images which lead to improving clinical outcomes. Alongside this, we have continuously upgraded our other hospital facilities in NorthGen, SouthGen, SanCarlosDoc, and MactanDoc like the expansion of Renal Intensive Care Units and medical wards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       In the second quarter, we introduced the newest addition to CebuDoc Group Wellness brands which is the CebuDoc Dental Institute equipped with the latest technology in dental care and a comprehensive array of dental services to be managed by a top-caliber roster of dentists. In the same quarter, we also brought the most advanced CT-Scan System in the Province of Leyte, upgraded our CDCare facilities in NorthGen and the CT-scan in MactanDoc and opened the first multi-person hyperbaric chamber in Visayas and Mindanao in CebuDoc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third quarter is jam-packed with the annual medical missions of CebuDoc, NorthGen, SouthGen, and MactanDoc. This is a way of commemorating the legacy of our late founder which is to bring healthcare closer to people. On top of that, we also supported several advocacy-groups through conducting a series of cause-oriented activities such as disability prevention week and the like. We also recognized outstanding healthcare heroes whose lives are worthy of emulation through the first-ever CDG Excellence Awards and Appreciation Night—the largest gathering of doctors in the Visayas. This was our way of showing our appreciation to their contribution to the growth of healthcare in the region.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Towards the last quarter, we launched another healthcare breakthrough in the Philippines as we made IQon Spectral CT Scan, the world’s first and only detector-based CT technology, available in CebuDoc that will revolutionize diagnostic imaging. We have also unveiled two new flagship projects for 2020—the upcoming BoholDoc and the CebuDoc Group Township where DanaoDoc will sit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We cap the year with a double win. CebuDoc and SouthGen were awarded Most Outstanding Hospitals by the Philippine Hospital Association. Indeed, it has been a colorful year for CebuDoc Group, filled with passion and grit exhibited by our beloved team. These projects would not be possible if not for the efforts and commitment of our healthcare heroes—our employees.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       Thus, in this year’s edition of Healthful Magazine, we will showcase to you the behindthe- scenes of all the milestones we have achieved. May you be inspired by the dedication and hard work of our employees who see healthcare as their vocation. This is our tribute to every member of CebuDoc Group – the people who motivate, cheer and work hard for the realization of our vision. Please continue reading and be inspired by the people of CebuDoc Group!
