                        <h3>THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN THE PHILIPPINES</h3>
                         CebuDoc’s commitment to innovation leads to the bringing of the latest diagnostic technology for the Filipinos. The hospital is the first in the country to install IQon Spectral CT Technology with Ambient Experience that helps in reducing patients’ stress and anxiety.

                      <p>
                        “CebuDoc has always been committed to bringing the latest healthcare technology for the Filipinos, especially for the Cebuanos. This is just one of the many efforts we do to boost our diagnostic confidence for a more reliable and credible diagnosis,” said Dr. Potenciano “Yong” S.D. Larrazabal, III, President and Chairman of CebuDoc Group.

                      <p>
                          CebuDoc Spectral CT with Ambient Experience is the first and only installation of the globally-known Royal Philips in the country. With such technology, the diagnosis will be faster, follow-up scans will be lesser, and data integrity is improved.

                      <p>
                         “With the healthcare challenges that the world is facing today – an aging population, the rise of chronic diseases and resource constraints – the healthcare industry needs solutions that deliver extraordinary diagnostic quality, empowering clinicians to improve clinical confidence and make the right diagnosis in the first scan,” said Ashwin Chari, country manager of Philips Philippines Inc.

                        <h3>
                          ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE
                        </h3>
                        The detector-based solution of Spectral CT introduces a unique scanning and clinical application experience, without the pre-decisions required for source-based solutions.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       “The best way to show compassion to our patients is to help them economically and this is our way of helping more Filipinos to be more cost-efficient especially in healthcare.> Technology such as IQon Spectral CT helps reduce the expenses of the patients and the hospital as it reduces scanning time meaning a shorter time for diagnosis and decrease in repeat scans,” said Dr. Philip Anthony S.D. Larrazabal, Chairman of CebuDoc Department of Radiology.

                      <p>
                        IN CONTRAST TO CONVENTIONAL CT SCAN
                        With IQon Spectral CT, CebuDoc commits that every scan is spectral without compromise. With such technology, there’s easier accommodation of a wide range of patient sizes from pediatric to bariatric.

                      <p>
                          There will also be an improved visualization and characterization of tissues resulting in diagnostic certainty.

                          “With the Philips IQon Spectral CT we can deliver more confident patient diagnoses in the first scan, representing a revolution in CT performance here in CebuDoc,” concludes Dr. Yong.
